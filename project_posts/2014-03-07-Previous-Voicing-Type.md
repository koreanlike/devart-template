## Type Modification

![Character Modification with applyForce function](../project_images/M.png?raw=true "Character Modification with applyForce function")
First algorithm to modify typefaces via a voice was inspired from [applyForce method](https://vimeo.com/channels/natureofcode/59028634) described in 'The Nature of Code', Daniel Shiffman's book. Since a voice is a physical force consists of the frequency spectrum, power, and intensity, using applyForce method to apply different forces to each node(point) in a character was valid approach. 


## The Very First Type Modification Algorithm:
- Set a hypothetical center point
- Analyse frequency spectrum of microphone inputs
- Map each of frequency values to each node
- Apply previously analysed forces continuously to each node from the center point to move them
- New composition of moved nodes generate new shape of a character
- Export the modified typeface


## And.. Voicing Type's First Version
![Voicing Type Application](../project_images/VoicingType-000.png?raw=true "Voicing Type Application")
A series of different type mofidication algorithms was tested, and I managed to choose an algorithm to develop Voicing Type further. GUI has been designed and developed to make users be able to interact with the application, though I believe GUI was not sufficient enough, and finally Voicing Type was operable.
